# Graph Visualizer

Graph Visualizer is a web application that allows users to construct and visualize graphs. Users can add vertices, create directed edges between vertices, and perform various graph algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and bipartite graph detection.

## Features

- Add vertices to the graph by clicking on the visited box.
- It can be selected which type of graph you want to make , for example directed weighted graph. all four type of graphs are available.
- Create directed edges between vertices by selecting start and end vertices.
- Perform Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal to explore the graph.
- Perform Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal to explore the graph.
- Detect whether the graph is bipartite or not.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Getting Started

To run the Graph Visualizer locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: 
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## How to Use

- Click the "Add Vertex" button and then click anywhere on the canvas to add a vertex.
- Click the "Add Edge" button and then click on two vertices to create a edge between them.
- Click the "BFS Traversal" button to perform a Breadth-First Search traversal starting from the any vertex to the graph.you just have to click first node from where BFS travesal is required.
- Click the "DFS Traversal" button to perform a Depth-First Search traversal starting from any vertex  to the graph. same as BFS , select starting Node and start DFS.
- Click the "Detect Bipartite Graph" button to determine if the graph is bipartite.
